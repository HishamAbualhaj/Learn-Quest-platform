          Artificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its conceptual
          origins in the mid-20th century. From simple rule-based systems to
          advanced machine learning algorithms, AI has transformed industries
          and reshaped how we interact with technology. But where exactly are we
          now, and where are we heading?
